                  Kelly and Sati not only went above and beyond they exceeded all expectations. Our relationship was built on trust and friendship and they guided us through the whole process. Being so particular about our vision we spent many late nights at their office but in the end we left it to them and our wedding decor blew us away - we walked into Chateau Impney and couldn’t believe how stunning it looked! Every detail was executed to perfection. We felt like teks we had walked into our Pinterest wedding lle Va of dreams!
                </p>

                <p>
                  2 years later and we still get people
                  complimenting us on our wedding decor.
                  Sati and Kelly created bespoke pieces
                  that we could only have dreamed of
                  - everything from the staging, to the
                  centre pieces and a large chandelier
                  were handcrafted and customised for the
                  wedding. Not only did they understand our
                  vision but were able to create and execute
                  it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We couldn’t recommend Vogue Luxury
                  Events enough - Sati’s creative flair paired
                  with Kelly’s execution skills make them an
                  unrivalled pair.
                </p>

                <p>

                  Sati, Kelly - we appreciate everything
                  you've done for us, you have a special
                  place in our hearts and will always be more
                  than just our wedding suppliers!
                </p>

                <p>Kelly, Sati and the team did a phenomenal job with the
                  décor for our wedding. They truly brought my vision to
                  life and understood from the first meeting exactly the
                  style and vibe | was going for. | really appreciated how
                  the team worked with me, using their expertise and
                  designs, as well as collaborating with my ideas. They
                  were professional, supportive, friendly, and at the top of
                  their game. Our wedding was a few months ago and
                  we still get comments from guests saying how amazing
                  the room was thanks to the unique and striking centre
                  pieces, the beautiful table cloths and the stunningly
                  dressed head table area, which far exceeded my
                  expectations. | 100% recommend Vogue Luxury Events
                  to anyone looking for a high-quality service and
                  product that is very reasonably priced. Thank you so
                  much for contributing to making the day perfect!</p>

                  Satin and Kelly are an amazing events planner! They
                  executed everything | wanted in order to give me a
                  secret garden themed wedding. They were so easy to
                  talk to as well as being so helpful. | would definitely
                  recommend you book with them!
                </p>
                <p>
                  They are here to help and understand all types of
                  budgets, which | found great! The quality of their work
                  is superb - if you haven't already checked them out on
                  Instagram, make sure you do!

                  We worked with Kelly and Sati from Vogue Luxury
                  Events for our Civil wedding and Reception party in
                  2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From Jyoti and |, we'd like to say a really big thank you
                  to Sati, your son and your team. Every single one of our
                  guests were blown away with the decor you put
                  together, the quality, the theme and the styling were are
                  exceptional. Kelly went above and beyond when |
                  wasn't on site by coordinating everything with the
                  different suppliers for me. It was a real pleasure
                  working with you on our parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our first conversation you said something that stuck
                  with me and made me think this is the company | want
                  to work with on our wedding. You told me you aren't
                  offering a decor service, you're providing an event
                  service where you want the whole day to go well for the
                  bride and groom. And that is exactly what you did -
                  thank you so much.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'd happily recommend Kelly and Vogue Luxury Events
                  to anyone wanting something special for their events.
